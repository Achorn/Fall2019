    "- Do **NOT** load or use any Python packages that are not available in Anaconda 3.6. \n",
    "- Because you can technically evaluate notebook cells in a non-linear order, it's a good idea to do Kernel $\\rightarrow$ Restart & Run All as a check before submitting your solutions.  That way if we need to run your code you will know that it will work as expected. \n",
    "- It is **bad form** to make your reader interpret numerical output from your code.  If a question asks you to compute some value from the data you should show your code output **AND** write a summary of the results in Markdown directly below your code. \n",
    "- You **MUST** leave all of your notebook cells **evaluated** so the graders do not need to re-evaluate them. For 100+ students, this extra time adds up, and makes the graders' lives unnecessarily more difficult.\n",
    "- This probably goes without saying, but... For any question that asks you to calculate something, you **must show all work and justify your answers to receive credit**. Sparse or nonexistent work will receive sparse or nonexistent credit. \n",

    "**Part B:** These data (and the sea-level data from Homework 4) are a **time series**, where the independent variable is *time* and the dependent quantity is interest in data science. One of the central assumptions of linear regression is that the data are observations generated by some process, independently of one another. With time series data, we need to be careful because there could be some other process affecting the output data. In particular, **annual cycles** are patterns that reoccur each year and are frequently present in time series data. For example, seasonal patterns of weather are annual cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see what kind of effect time has, make a **line plot** (using `pyplot.plot`) of the interest in data science, as a function of time. Again, include all of the data points and, for the x-axis, label only the tick marks associated with January of each year, and be sure to label your axes."
