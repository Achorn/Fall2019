    "# CSCI 3022: Intro to Data Science - Fall 2019 Practicum 2\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "This practicum is due on Canvas by **11:59 PM on Wednesday December 11**. Your solutions to theoretical questions should be done in Markdown/MathJax directly below the associated question.  Your solutions to computational questions should include any specified Python code and results as well as written commentary on your conclusions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Here are the rules:** \n",
    "\n",
    "1. All work, code and analysis, must be your own. \n",
    "1. You may use your course notes, posted lecture slides, textbooks, in-class notebooks, and homework solutions as resources.  You may also search online for answers to general knowledge questions like the form of a probability distribution function or how to perform a particular operation in Python/Pandas. \n",
    "1. This is meant to be like a coding portion of your midterm exam. So, the instructional team will be much less helpful than we typically are with homework. For example, we will not check answers, help debug your code, and so on.\n",
    "1. If something is left open-ended, it is because we want to see how you approach the kinds of problems you will encounter in the wild, where it will not always be clear what sort of tests/methods should be applied. Feel free to ask clarifying questions though.\n",
    "2. You may **NOT** post to message boards or other online resources asking for help.\n",
    "3. You may **NOT** copy-paste solutions *from anywhere*.\n",
    "4. You may **NOT** collaborate with classmates or anyone else.\n",
    "5. In short, **your work must be your own**. It really is that simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Violation of the above rules will result in an immediate academic sanction (*at the very least*, you will receive a 0 on this practicum or an F in the course, depending on severity), and a trip to the Honor Code Council.\n",
    "\n",
    "**By submitting this assignment, you agree to abide by the rules given above.**\n",

    "**NOTES**: \n",
    "\n",
    "- You may not use late days on the practicums nor can you drop your practicum grades. \n",
    "- If you have a question for us, post it as a **PRIVATE** message on Piazza.  If we decide that the question is appropriate for the entire class, then we will add it to a Practicum clarifications thread. \n",
    "- Do **NOT** load or use any Python packages that are not available in Anaconda 3.6. \n",
    "- Some problems with code may be autograded.  If we provide a function API **do not** change it.  If we do not provide a function API then you're free to structure your code however you like. \n",
    "- Submit only this Jupyter notebook to Canvas.  Do not compress it using tar, rar, zip, etc. \n",
    "- This should go without saying, but... For any question that asks you to calculate something, you **must show all work to receive credit**. Sparse or nonexistent work will receive sparse or nonexistent credit.\n",

    "2. Drop any rows with null values in any of the remaining columns\n",

    "3. Convert the Portugese month names to English month names. We've included the 'month_name' and the 'different_encoding' modules of the python calendar library in the top cell above, if you would like to use them. There are many ways to accomplish this task, and these modules are not required, but may make things easier. As part of this step, you should make sure that the Portugese month with the encoding problem is translated to the correct English month. \n",
    "4. Check the number column for any values that seem impossible. Drop any negative or fractional values, or any values over 50,000. 50,000 is large enough that no Brazilian state would ever have that many forest fires in one month, so we should get rid of anything above 50000. \n",
    "5. Since you're new on the job, some of your co-workers may have played a prank on you... Print out all the unique values of the 'year' column and drop any rows with values that don't make sense.\n",
    "6. Find the total number of rows remaining after you've done all of the above and write it out in a markdown cell. if you have correctly performed all of the tasks above, your dataframe should now have 6438 rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** Since some of these tasks are not totally trivial, you may use any resources other than your classmates on this part of this problem. This means you may consult google, stack overflow, the python/pandas documentation, some random book on pandas you might have, etc... But you may not consult your classmates for help. ***CITE ALL RESOURCES USED IN A CODE COMMENT. A URL OR A BOOK TITLE IS SUFFICIENT.

Plot two vertical lines that represent the outer bounds of the 95% confidence interval on the true median for each state, in the same color as the state.

    "### [40 points] Problem 2:  Sharknado Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "Governor Hickenlooper has charged you with the task of assessing the factors associated with sharknado risk in Colorado. As everyone knows, sharknadoes are a leading cause of sharknado-related illness, and you are a world-renowned data/shark scientist.\n",
    "\n",
    "You decide to use multiple linear regression to understand and predict what factors lead to increased sharknado hazard. Your lead scientist, aptly named Fin, has collected lots of relevant data at a local sharknado hotspot, the Boulder Reservoir[\\*](#footnote). The data cover a variety of sharknado-related environmental and other conditions, and you'll find this data in the file `sharknadoes.csv`. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Response**: \n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\texttt{sharknado hazard}$: the hazard of a sharknado, where 1 is very unlikely and 100 is highly likely\n",
    "\n",
    "**Features**: \n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\texttt{taunts}$: the number of times over the past year that someone has taunted a shark\n",
    "- $\\texttt{clouds}$: what percentage of the sky was covered by clouds (fraction, 0-1)\n",
    "- $\\texttt{precipitation}$: amount of precipitation in the past 72 hours (inches)\n",
    "- $\\texttt{earthquake}$: the intensity of the most recent earthquake measured in the continental United States\n",
    "- $\\texttt{shark attacks}$: the number of shark attacks within 72 hours prior to the observation\n",
    "- $\\texttt{ice cream sold}$: the number of units of ice cream sold at the beach concession stand \n",
    "- $\\texttt{misery index}$: an economic indicator for how miserable the average United States citizen is, based on the unemployment rate and the inflation rate. More [here](https://www.stuffyoushouldknow.com/podcasts/whats-the-misery-index.htm) and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misery_index_(economics)). Higher values correspond to more miserable citizens.\n",
    "- $\\texttt{temperature}$: the outside temperature, measured in degrees Fahrenheit\n",
    "- $\\texttt{humidity}$: relative humidity (percent, 0-100)\n",
    "- $\\texttt{pizzas sold}$: the number of pizzas sold at the beach concession stand in the past year\n",
    "- $\\texttt{pressure}$: local air pressure (millibar) \n",
    "- $\\texttt{octopuses}$: the number of octupuses in the vicinity on the day of the observation\n",
    "- $\\texttt{Zach's shoe size}$: the size of the shoes Zach was wearing when the observation was made\n",
    "- $\\texttt{Rachel's shoe size}$: the size of the shoes Rachel was wearing when the observation was made"

Use your code to determine the reduced MLR model with the minimal number of features such that the SSE of the reduced model is less than 570.
